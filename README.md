# Password_Project
This project will generate a random password based on selections made by the user.  

This webpage will ask the user how long of a password they would like to generate.  
If the user hits the cancel key, processing will stop.
If the user enters anything other than a number, a message stating that a password could not be generated will be displayed to the user.  
If the user enter a numeric value, it will be checked.  Value must be greater than 7 and less than 128. 

After the password length has been validated, the user will be prompted for the criteria to use in generating the password.  The user will have the option of special characters (including spaces), upper and lower case letters and numbers.  

If no selections are chosen, a message will be displayed to the user stating that a password could not be generated. 

If the user has selected one or multiple of the choices asked for, a password will be created and displayed on the screen.  The user can then copy and paste the password to whereever they wish to use it.
